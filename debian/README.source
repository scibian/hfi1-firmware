hfi1-firmware for Debian
------------------------

The tarball is created merging the file for un-rpmping both tarballs
hfi1-firmware-$VERSION.noarch.rpm and hfi1-firmware_debug-$VERSION.noarch.rpm.
All the files from from usr/share/doc/... were copied into the tree directory
and later installed using dh.
